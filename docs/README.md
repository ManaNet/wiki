## :book: About Mana

Mana is a Discord bot that is built using Javacord by a single developer, Shindou Mihou with its initial purpose
was to replace the functionalities of other bots but slowly turned into a Discord bot that focuses on the anime
community more.

## :computer: Features

- Yuriverse, one of the main attractions of Mana which is its hourly *(quarterly for Premium users)* Yuri (or Shoujo-Ai) images.
- WaifuWorld, another of the main attractions which derived from Yuriverse but instead of Yuri, it sends Waifu images at an quarterly basis.
- Anime Pictures, the bot can provide anime pictures almost immediately through either slash commands or message commands *example: pa.waifu*
- Welcome/Leave Messages, the bot can replace your current welcome/leave Discord bot with image support, reducing your bot count.
- Warnings, you can also use the bot to give out warnings to other users!
- Emoji Migration, you can add emojis from other servers directly to your server without much hassle, this saves a lot of time for many mobile users!
- And many more, try them out!
