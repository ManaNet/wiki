## :smiley: Emoji Migration
Ever grown tired of manually inserting all the emojis yourself, downloading them from your other server and readding them to your new server... what if you could go faster? That is what Emoji Migration command is for.

## :innocent: How to migrate an emoji from one server to another?

You can grab another server's emoji easily and import it into your server through a specialized command which is called `steal` *cough* which allows you to add 20 emojis per request *(for non-Premium, Premium users have a higher limit)*

```
steal [emoji/s]
```

An example usage would be:

```
steal 😀😃😁
```

Image example of the following:

You can also attach an image when running this command like what is shown below.

You can also steal an emoji from another message by replying to the message with the steal command, for example:

## :gear: Options

There are also options when running this command, for example, you can run. For example, setting a defined name for the emoji.

```
steal [emoji/s] --name [name]
```

> The --name option will set all the emojis that will be added's name into what is defined.

## :newspaper: Important Notes
The first method where you mention the emoji attached requires you have to **NITRO** which is a Discord limitation. You can ask a friend to spam emojis for you and use the last method which is replying to each spammed emoji which is a bypass.
